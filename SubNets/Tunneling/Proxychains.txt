In some cases, before to be able to send data through a tunnel we need to use proxychains.

Proxychains redirect the data developed by other tool over the address configured on the botton of the /etc/proxychains4.conf file. So this address must be the gate to the HTTP tunel and it can vair un function in how the tunnel is configured, it could be an address in a local machine or in a target machine and it must configured properly.
