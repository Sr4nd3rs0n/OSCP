::If OpenSSH is by default installed in the machine it can be found on:
%systemdrive%\Windows\System32\OpenSSH

::Here we can find utilities like ssh.exe, scp.exe, sftp.exe, etc. The commands seeing in the SSHTunneling directory are valids but some little customization must be done like change ssh.exe instead ssh.
