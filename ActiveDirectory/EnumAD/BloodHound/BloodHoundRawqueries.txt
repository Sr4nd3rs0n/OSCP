In the final part of the BloodHound's GUI we can find a section in which we can type RawQueries. This is a very useful tool that we can use along with the PreBuilt queries in order to extract information. 

We can find more information about RawQueries in the following URL: https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/

Some of the more interesting RawQueries we can use are:


MATCH (m:User) RETURN m --- Find all users on domain.

MATCH (m:Computer) RETURN m --- Find all computers object on domain.


We can also combine this results with the following PreBuilt queries:


Find Workstations where Domain Users can RDP
Find Servers where Domain Users can RDP
Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin
Shortest Path to Domain Admins from Owned Principals
