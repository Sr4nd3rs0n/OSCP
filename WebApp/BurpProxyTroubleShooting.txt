If we launch an exploit against a webapp and fails, we can attemp to init a proxy that redirects request over our target in order to see if we can check the request the exploits send in order to solve the problem.

- Open BurpSuite.
- Proxy > Proxy Settings

Then a new menu will open:

- Tools > Proxy > Proxy listeners
- Edit 127.0.0.1:8080

Then a new menu will open:

- Request handling 

	-> Redirect to host: <TARGETIP>
	-> Redirect to port: <TARGETPORT>

- OK


Then all we have to do is launch the exploit against 127.0.0.1:8080 and press Intercept Request. 
Once we intercept one request:

- Right click > Do intercept > Response of this request.
- Forward
