Sometimes is important to try to add some chars before to assum that some detect/exploit paylod isn't valid. Some of them are:

--  (There is a space after the double quotes).
;<STATEMENT>-- (This is particullary true if we want to add a SLEEP statement,for example ;SELECT PG_SLEEP(5)-- //) 
-- //
-- /*

And even more combinations.
