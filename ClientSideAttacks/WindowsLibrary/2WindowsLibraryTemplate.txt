This Windows Library file is pinned to the Windows Explorer engine and would act as a open directory once open.
The <url> tag ensure that the contents of the directory are those stored in the webDAV share hosted by our Kali machine.

This XML code has to be pasted to a single file with the extension .Library-ms and this is the file that has to be sended to the user.
